The first assignment is keypoint detection and description. For the detection part, you have to implement a keypoint detector to output a list of keypoints. Then, based on these points, extract patches from the original image. The images are in ***keypoint_detector/img***. Details see the notebook ***keypoint_detection.ipynb***

For the descrition part, you have to train a descriptor from given dataset. The details are given in the notebook ***keypoint_detection.ipynb***
